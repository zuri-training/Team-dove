## Project Description

Auth-wiki is a library of multi-factor authentication codes. 

The aim of the platform is to provide quick access to authentication code snippets and libraries for developers, in order to fastrack their software development timeline.

The platform is built on the principle of *(Don’t re-invent the wheel)*. 

As a developer, you do not have to waste time writing classes or libraries for managing user authentication in your project.

All you need to do is to visit the platform, browse through a list of authentication codes written in your preferred programming language, then login to download the code snippet.

You can equally contribute to the libraries via comments as long as you are a registered user of the community.

## Project Implementation

This is a web application built using a PHP framework called Laravel. This framework has a wide range of functionality and works perfectly with both small and large web application. 

The entire template provided by the frontend developers will be converted to "blade" template which will be used in the application. 

The authentication codes for various language and frameworks will be made available for download and a concise description will be provided for each code. 

The authenticated users will also be able to show how satisfied they are and this will help the future users make an informed decision.
